    <h2>Types of Trains and How They Work</h2>
    <p>
      Trains come in various types, each designed for specific functions and
      operating under different mechanisms. Below is an overview of the main
      types of trains and how they operate.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h3>Steam Locomotives</h3>
        <p>
          The steam pressure moves the pistons, which turn the wheels. Steam
          locomotives were the first type of trains and played a crucial role in
          the 19th century.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Diesel Locomotives</h3>
        <p>
          There are diesel engines can be either diesel-electric or
          diesel-mechanical. In diesel-electric locomotives, a diesel engine
          generates electricity to power electric traction motors.
          Diesel-mechanical systems use gears to drive the wheels directly.
          These became predominant after World War II due to their efficiency
          and lower operational costs compared to steam.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Electric Locomotives</h3>
        <p>
          Powered by electricity supplied through overhead wires or an
          electrified rail. Electric motors drive the wheels, offering higher
          speeds and better acceleration compared to diesel or steam. They are
          commonly used in urban transit systems and high-speed rail networks.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>High-Speed Trains</h3>
        <p>
          Designed for rapid transit over long distances, these trains operate
          on specialized tracks. They can reach speeds of 300 km/h (186 mph) or
          more, utilizing streamlined designs and advanced technologies like
          dedicated high-speed rail lines. Examples include Japan's Shinkansen
          and France's TGV.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Maglev Trains</h3>
        <p>
          Use magnetic levitation to float above the tracks, eliminating
          friction. Powerful magnets lift and propel the train forward at high
          speeds, with some models exceeding 600 km/h (373 mph) during tests.
          This technology is still developing but offers significant speed
          advantages.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Freight Trains</h3>
        <p>
          Trains designed primarily for transporting goods rather than
          passengers. Composed of various car types (e.g., boxcars, tankers),
          these trains can haul large quantities of cargo across long distances
          efficiently.
