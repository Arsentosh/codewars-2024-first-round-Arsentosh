    <h1>Škoda RegioPanter</h1>
    <h2>Creation and Development</h2>
    <p>
      Škoda Transportation, a subsidiary of the PPF Group, began producing the
      RegioPanter series in 2011. The RegioPanter was designed as a modern
      electric multiple unit (EMU) for regional and suburban rail services,
      aiming to enhance passenger comfort and accessibility.
    </p>
    <h2>Features and Specifications</h2>
    <p>
      Available in two to six-car units, with lengths ranging from 52.9 meters
      for two-car units to 159.2 meters for six-car units. Depending on the
      configuration, the RegioPanter can accommodate between 147 to 400
      passengers. The train can reach speeds of up to 160 km/h on electrified
      tracks and 120 km/h on battery power. The latest models include battery
      technology allowing for zero-emission operation on non-electrified
      sections, making them an eco-friendly alternative to diesel trains.
    </p>
    <h2>Current Status</h2>
    <p>
      As of 2024, Czech Railways plans to deploy four battery-powered
      RegioPanter trains in the Moravian-Silesian Region. This initiative marks
      a significant step towards sustainable rail transport in the region.
      Bulgaria has also contracted Škoda Group for up to 25 barrier-free
      RegioPanter EMUs, with a firm order for 20 units, set to replace outdated
      rolling stock and improve passenger services.
