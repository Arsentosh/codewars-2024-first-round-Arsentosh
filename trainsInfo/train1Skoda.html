      <h1>Škoda RegioPanter</h1>

      <h2>Overview and Purpose</h2>

      <p>
        The Škoda RegioPanter is an electric multiple unit (EMU) developed by
        Škoda Transportation (a PPF Group subsidiary) for regional and suburban
        rail services. Launched in 2011, the RegioPanter was designed to
        modernize regional rail transport, providing enhanced passenger comfort,
        accessibility, and energy efficiency.
      </p>

      <h2>Creation and Development</h2>

      <p>
        Škoda Transportation, a subsidiary of the PPF Group, began producing the
        RegioPanter series in 2011. The RegioPanter was designed as a modern
        electric multiple unit (EMU) for regional and suburban rail services,
        aiming to enhance passenger comfort and accessibility.
      </p>

      <h2>Features and Specifications</h2>

      <p>
        Available in two to six-car units, with lengths ranging from 52.9 meters
        for two-car units to 159.2 meters for six-car units. Depending on the
        configuration, the RegioPanter can accommodate between 147 to 400
        passengers. The train can reach speeds of up to 160 km/h on electrified
        tracks and 120 km/h on battery power. The latest models include battery
        technology allowing for zero-emission operation on non-electrified
        sections, making them an eco-friendly alternative to diesel trains.
      </p>

      <h2>Current Status</h2>

      <p>
        As of 2024, Czech Railways plans to deploy four battery-powered
        RegioPanter trains in the Moravian-Silesian Region. This initiative
        marks a significant step towards sustainable rail transport in the
        region. Bulgaria has also contracted Škoda Group for up to 25
        barrier-free RegioPanter EMUs, with a firm order for 20 units, set to
        replace outdated rolling stock and improve passenger services.
