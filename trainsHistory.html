    <h2>History of trains</h2>
        <p>
          The history of trains is a fascinating journey that spans thousands of
          years, evolving from simple wooden rails to the high-speed networks we
          see today. Below is an overview of key developments in the evolution
          of rail transport.
        </p>
        <h3>Early Beginnings</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h4>Ancient Origins:</h4>
            The concept of rail transport dates back to ancient civilizations,
            such as Greece and Rome, where grooves were cut into stone to guide
            wheeled vehicles. These early systems improved the efficiency of
            transporting goods.

            <h4>Wagonways</h4>
            The first true railways emerged in the 16th century with wooden
            "wagonways" in Germany, primarily used for transporting coal from
            mines. These were horse-drawn and laid the groundwork for future
            developments.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>The Steam Revolution</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h4>Invention of the Steam Locomotive:</h4>
            The first steam locomotive was built by Richard Trevithick in 1804,
            marking a significant milestone in rail transport. This innovation
            allowed trains to carry both freight and passengers at unprecedented
            speeds.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Expansion in Britain:</h4>
            The Stockton and Darlington Railway, opened in 1825, was the first
            public railway to use steam locomotives. This was followed by the
            Liverpool and Manchester Railway in 1830, which set standards for
            modern rail systems.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Global Spread</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h4>International Adoption:</h4>
            Following Britain's lead, many countries began constructing their
            own railways in the 1830s and 1840s. By 1900, railroads were
            operational on every continent except Antarctica.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Colonial Railroads:</h4>
            Imperial powers built railroads in their colonies during the 19th
            century to facilitate resource extraction and control over
            territories. Notably, Japan developed its railway system
            independently in the early 1870s.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>The Decline of Steam and Rise of Modern Rail</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h4>Transition to Diesel and Electric:</h4>
            Starting in the early 20th century, steam locomotives gradually gave
            way to diesel and electric trains, which offered greater efficiency
            and reliability. By the late 20th century, most steam engines had
            been retired from regular service.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>High-Speed Rail:</h4>
            The introduction of high-speed rail began with Japan's Shinkansen in
            1964, revolutionizing passenger travel. Today, many countries have
            developed extensive high-speed networks that compete with air travel
            for speed and efficiency.
