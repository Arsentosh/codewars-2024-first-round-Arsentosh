      <h2>History of trains</h2>
      <p>
        The history of trains is a fascinating journey that spans thousands of
        years, evolving from simple wooden rails to the high-speed networks we
        see today. Below is an overview of key developments in the evolution of
        rail transport.
      </p>
      <h3>Early Beginnings</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h4>Ancient Origins:</h4>
          The concept of rail transport dates back to ancient civilizations,
          such as Greece and Rome, where grooves were cut into stone to guide
          wheeled vehicles. These early systems improved the efficiency of
          transporting goods.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Wagonways</h4>
          The first true railways emerged in the 16th century with wooden
          "wagonways" in Germany, primarily used for transporting coal from
          mines. These were horse-drawn and laid the groundwork for future
          developments.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>The Steam Revolution</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h4>Invention of the Steam Locomotive:</h4>
          The first steam locomotive was built by Richard Trevithick in 1804,
          marking a significant milestone in rail transport. This innovation
          allowed trains to carry both freight and passengers at unprecedented
          speeds.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Expansion in Britain:</h4>
          The Stockton and Darlington Railway, opened in 1825, was the first
          public railway to use steam locomotives. This was followed by the
          Liverpool and Manchester Railway in 1830, which set standards for
          modern rail systems.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Global Spread</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h4>International Adoption:</h4>
          Following Britain's lead, many countries began constructing their own
          railways in the 1830s and 1840s. By 1900, railroads were operational
          on every continent except Antarctica.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Colonial Railroads:</h4>
          Imperial powers built railroads in their colonies during the 19th
          century to facilitate resource extraction and control over
          territories. Notably, Japan developed its railway system independently
          in the early 1870s.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>The Decline of Steam and Rise of Modern Rail</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h4>Transition to Diesel and Electric:</h4>
          Starting in the early 20th century, steam locomotives gradually gave
          way to diesel and electric trains, which offered greater efficiency
          and reliability. By the late 20th century, most steam engines had been
          retired from regular service.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>High-Speed Rail:</h4>
          The introduction of high-speed rail began with Japan's Shinkansen in
          1964, revolutionizing passenger travel. Today, many countries have
          developed extensive high-speed networks that compete with air travel
          for speed and efficiency.
