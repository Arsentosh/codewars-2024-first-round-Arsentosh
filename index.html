            <h3>Stadler KISS Double-Decker Trains</h3>
            <p>
              Bulgaria has ordered seven double-decker electric trains from
              Stadler's KISS series, with an option for three additional units.
              These zero-emission trains will feature a minimum of 300 seats,
              with over 10% reserved for passengers with reduced mobility. The
              contract emphasizes modern design and environmental
              sustainability, with delivery expected by 2026.
