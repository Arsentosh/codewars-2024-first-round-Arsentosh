        <section>
          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>
            The history of trains is a fascinating journey that spans thousands
            of years, evolving from simple wooden rails to the high-speed
            networks we see today. Below is an overview of key developments in
            the evolution of rail transport.
          </p>
          <h3>Early Beginnings</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h4>Ancient Origins:</h4>
              The concept of rail transport dates back to ancient civilizations,
              such as Greece and Rome, where grooves were cut into stone to
              guide wheeled vehicles. These early systems improved the
              efficiency of transporting goods.
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Wagonways</h4>
              The first true railways emerged in the 16th century with wooden
              "wagonways" in Germany, primarily used for transporting coal from
              mines. These were horse-drawn and laid the groundwork for future
              developments.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>The Steam Revolution</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h4>Invention of the Steam Locomotive:</h4>
              The first steam locomotive was built by Richard Trevithick in
              1804, marking a significant milestone in rail transport. This
              innovation allowed trains to carry both freight and passengers at
              unprecedented speeds.
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Expansion in Britain:</h4>
              The Stockton and Darlington Railway, opened in 1825, was the first
              public railway to use steam locomotives. This was followed by the
              Liverpool and Manchester Railway in 1830, which set standards for
              modern rail systems.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Global Spread</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h4>International Adoption:</h4>
              Following Britain's lead, many countries began constructing their
              own railways in the 1830s and 1840s. By 1900, railroads were
              operational on every continent except Antarctica.
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Colonial Railroads:</h4>
              Imperial powers built railroads in their colonies during the 19th
              century to facilitate resource extraction and control over
              territories. Notably, Japan developed its railway system
              independently in the early 1870s.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>The Decline of Steam and Rise of Modern Rail</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h4>Transition to Diesel and Electric:</h4>
              Starting in the early 20th century, steam locomotives gradually
              gave way to diesel and electric trains, which offered greater
              efficiency and reliability. By the late 20th century, most steam
              engines had been retired from regular service.
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>High-Speed Rail:</h4>
              The introduction of high-speed rail began with Japan's Shinkansen
              in 1964, revolutionizing passenger travel. Today, many countries
              have developed extensive high-speed networks that compete with air
              travel for speed and efficiency.

        <!-- --------------TYPES & HOW THEY WORK -->
        <section>
          <h2>Types of Trains and How They Work</h2>
          <p>
            Trains come in various types, each designed for specific functions
            and operating under different mechanisms. Below is an overview of
            the main types of trains and how they operate.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <h3>Steam Locomotives</h3>
              <p>
                The steam pressure moves the pistons, which turn the wheels.
                Steam locomotives were the first type of trains and played a
                crucial role in the 19th century.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Diesel Locomotives</h3>
              <p>
                There are diesel engines can be either diesel-electric or
                diesel-mechanical. In diesel-electric locomotives, a diesel
                engine generates electricity to power electric traction motors.
                Diesel-mechanical systems use gears to drive the wheels
                directly. These became predominant after World War II due to
                their efficiency and lower operational costs compared to steam.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Electric Locomotives</h3>
              <p>
                Powered by electricity supplied through overhead wires or an
                electrified rail. Electric motors drive the wheels, offering
                higher speeds and better acceleration compared to diesel or
                steam. They are commonly used in urban transit systems and
                high-speed rail networks.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>High-Speed Trains</h3>
              <p>
                Designed for rapid transit over long distances, these trains
                operate on specialized tracks. They can reach speeds of 300 km/h
                (186 mph) or more, utilizing streamlined designs and advanced
                technologies like dedicated high-speed rail lines. Examples
                include Japan's Shinkansen and France's TGV.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Maglev Trains</h3>
              <p>
                Use magnetic levitation to float above the tracks, eliminating
                friction. Powerful magnets lift and propel the train forward at
                high speeds, with some models exceeding 600 km/h (373 mph)
                during tests. This technology is still developing but offers
                significant speed advantages.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Freight Trains</h3>
              <p>
                Trains designed primarily for transporting goods rather than
                passengers. Composed of various car types (e.g., boxcars,
                tankers), these trains can haul large quantities of cargo across
                long distances efficiently.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Passenger Trains</h3>
              <p>Types:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Inter-City Trains: Connect major cities with comfortable
                  seating and amenities.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Regional Trains: Serve shorter distances with frequent stops.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Trams/Light Rail: Operate within urban areas, typically at
                  lower speeds.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
